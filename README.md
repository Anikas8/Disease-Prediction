# Heart Disease Prediction System
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health factors using machine learning models.
## Technologies
Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Streamlit (for the UI, optional)
### Features
Data preprocessing to clean and prepare health data.
Predicts heart disease risk using machine learning models.
Real-time predictions based on user input.
Visualizes prediction results and relevant statistics.
#### Dataset
Uses the Heart Disease UCI Dataset from Kaggle, which contains features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more to predict the presence of heart disease. You can download the dataset from Kaggle
